#in a new project after installing ros-rospy - in a fact rospy is just a part of rospkg
# at every new terminal opening its trying to change ros distro
change file name/ or just remove , also remove file in cache folder
/home/aa/anaconda3/envs/vawt_35/etc/conda/activate.d/ros_setup.sh
so that it wont be called

# theres also sometimes set of scripts under /home/aa/anaconda3/envs/vawt_35/etc/catkin/profile.d
edit 1.ros_distro.sh to set apropriate distro
as well as /home/aa/anaconda3/envs/vawt_35/share/ros_environment/catkin_env_hook

# uninstalled ros-rosbuild package

set in File-Preferences-Tools-Terminal-enivronment
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/aa/vawt_env/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share


# for in ide run scripts using rospy you need to
PyCharm plugin called EnvFile

file .env content
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/aa/vawt_env/src:/home/aa/image_transport_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

after that when you want run a script you must edit its run configurations ( click dropdown box to the left of run icon
in upper right corner) pick envfile tab, add env file to be loaded before start
